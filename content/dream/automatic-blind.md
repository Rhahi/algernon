## A weekend project

I live in a place where I get blinding sunlight in the afternoon.
This is problematic for reading what's written on the monitor.
So, I am going to make a deployable blind.

### At the end of the project...

- I will have learned Fusion360 with focus on 3D printing
- I will have a motorized blind connected to Home Assistant

### Scope

- Use ESPHome for the controlling hardware
- Use hardware available at home
- Keep it as a weekend project

### Materials

- A random step motor (28BYJ-48, 5VDC)
- A random motor driver with board (ULN2093APG)
- A spool of PETG filament
- Cardboard

## Requirements

Create a design that will hold on to the blind without punching holes on the walls or frames.

This is because there is no drywall around the window to drill holes in. It will be difficult to fill in holes in them when we move out. Instead, I will take inspiration from my previous project and find ways to hold on to frames with friction.

## Strategy

- I will check out Fusion360 official YouTube channel for some overview guides
- There may be some other good tutorials to follow along
- I will iterate with design and print until I get a good enough product.
