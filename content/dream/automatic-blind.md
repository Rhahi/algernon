## A weekend project

I live in a place where I get blinding sunlight by the time I come home.
This is problematic for reading what's written on the monitor.
So, I am going to make a deployable blind.

### At the end of the project...

- I will have learned Fusion360 with focus on 3D printing
- I will have a motorized blind connected to Home Assistant

### Scope

- Use ESPHome for the controlling hardware
- Use hardware available at home
- Keep it as a weekend project

### Materials

- A random step motor (28BYJ-48, 5VDC)
- A random motor driver with board (ULN2093APG)
- A spool of PETG filament
- Cardboard

## Requirements

Create a design that will hold on to the blind without punching holes on the walls or frames.

This is because the window what I am trying to block is not on a drywall, so putting any holes in there will make it difficult for repairs for the next tenants. Instead, I will take inspiration from my previous project and find ways to hold on to frames with friction.

## Strategy

- I will check out Fusion360 official YouTube channel for some overview guides
- There may be some other good tutorials to follow along
- I will iterate with design and print until I get a good enough product.
